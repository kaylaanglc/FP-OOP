PACMAN
This simple Pac Man game coded in Java using Java Swing is a homage to the original,
with a log in feature, visual style, points system, power-ups and enemies
This game has a simple gameplay, although the ghosts and the speed give the players a hard time,
and that hard time becomes progressively harder as the player has less lives.
